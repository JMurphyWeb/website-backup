      <h3>An Unbelievably Good Blog</h3>
      <p id="date">21 August 2015</p>
      <p>The Labour leadership frontrunner, Jeremy Corbyn, has said he does not do “personal, reaction or abuse”, after dire warnings from Tony Blair and Yvette Cooper about the prospect of his leading the party.</p>

      <p>Corbyn said life was too short to respond and the attitude devalued the political process, after fellow candidate Cooper said his polices were not credible and could split the party, and the former prime minister Blair said his ideas could lead
        Labour to annihilation.</p>
      <p>

        Asked about the comments, Corbyn, the MP for Islington North, told the Guardian: “We’re in the midst of the biggest democratic process that the Labour party has ever been involved with. Hundreds of thousands of people are party members and union supporters
        and registered supporters, a lot of them are young people who’ve never been involved in party politics before but involved in other activities like the environment or peace or student issues, and older people who have come back to Labour.</p>
      <p>

        “Shouldn’t we be happy about that? Shouldn’t we be happy that it’s a popular discussion and a popular debate, and a choice will be made. And after 12 September , whoever wins the election, there’s going to have to be a big discussion about the policy
        direction of our party: on austerity, on Trident, on many many other issues. We’ve used this campaign to put forward policy issues on the economy, the environment, arts policy.</p>
      <p>

        “We’re the one putting forward ideas, so I don’t do personal, I don’t do reaction, I don’t do abuse. Life is too short and it devalues the political process. I think we should try and enhance the democratic life of this country, not reduce it to that
        level.”</p>
      <p>

        Corbyn is now the clear favourite to win the contest, according to polls and internal data from at least three of the campaigns.</p>

        British politics?</p>

        Listen Andy Burnham, the MP for Leigh, and Cooper (who represents Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford) are battling for second place, while Liz Kendall, MP for Leicester West, appears to be trailing last.
