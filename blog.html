          Tonight I have been looking into using GitHub through the command line.  This is not supposed to be a <a href=“http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository”>guide</a> but more a log of the commands needed to perform basic actions. Commands include: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="cmnd-line"> $ git clone </span> &nbsp; - take repository from GitHub to your local computer by pasting the repo&#8217;s url.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="cmnd-line"> $ git status </span> &nbsp; - checks whether the repo&#8217;s branch is up to date with your local branch
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="cmnd-line"> $ git branch </span> &nbsp; - tells you which branch you are currently working in
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="cmnd-line"> $ git checkout </span> &nbsp; - allows you to change branch from <em>master</em> to <em>gh-pages</em> and back</li>
          <li>
            <span class="cmnd-line"> $ git add </span> &nbsp; - add updates and new files to be committed to GitHub
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="cmnd-line"> $ git commit -m "" </span> &nbsp; - commit the changes to your GitHub account
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="cmnd-line"> $ git push </span> &nbsp; - pushes changes onto your GitHub page
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p>
          As can be seen from the URL, I am hosting this site through GitHub&#8217;s gh-pages. The basic steps in setting up your page on GitHub are: 
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li>On selected repository create a new branch called <em>gh-pages</em> in GitHub</li>
            <li>Under Settings, choose gh-pages branch as the default branch</li>
            <li>Add files to this new branch locally, with the desired homepage set to index.html</li>
            <li>Add, commit and push these files to GitHub</li>
            <li>Check out your new website at: githubusername.github.io.repositoryname</li>
          </ol>

          <br>
          <p>
            One thing that I have not managed to get to grips with: when making a change to the master branch, the git add commit push combination works perfectly, then switch to the gh-pages branch and I am struggling to use the merge command to update the file.  A bit of research tells me a <a href="http://oli.jp/2011/github-pages-workflow/">post-commit hook</a> is what I should be looking into, but for now I will stick to just using the gh-pages branch as the default and not worry about the master branch.

        <h3 class="post-title">Finally a post!</h3>
        <p class="post-date">15 August 2015</p>

        <p>Website is up and ready, far from perfect but I will look to iron out any problems in the coming weeks.  I think I will post the site on Reddit&#8217;s r/learn-web-dev forum which I hope will provide some useful feedback.</p>
               
        <p>So, the website is more or less ok, which means I cannot put off what is my first ever blog post, any longer.  It&#8217;s probably been lurking somewhere at the bottom of several to-do lists for a few months now, along with making granola bars.  Making to-do lists is one of my main strengths, I like to wait until my caffeine high kicks into bionic stage, before whipping out my chosen ink and parchment and devising a ridiculously unachievable list.  I never learn, but I stand by them.</p>
        
        <p>However time is running out for me as I am catching an overnight bus up into northern Vietnam very soon. The idea of this blog is to record the steps that I take in my quest to learn web-dev, I will log any good resources I have found and used.  For this first post, I wanted to write about the making of this site, but I guess I&#8217;ll have to stick it on the next to do list.  Keep an eye out for my photo a day.</p>
